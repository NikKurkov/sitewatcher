# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-30

- Start with built-in defaults when no YAML file is present.
- Run scheduled checks according to their own intervals and per-domain overrides.
- Keep each owner's settings isolated and combine recent results before deciding alert severity.
- Fix CLI checks, ad-hoc bot checks, HTTP proxies, ports, WHOIS initialization, and `.env` database path loading.
- Keep partial YAML domain check flags layered over global defaults; reject invalid CLI domains and check names.
- Keep VirusTotal quota state across checks and prevent cached manual results from extending their own TTL.
- Save each run's history in one SQLite transaction and close database connections promptly.
- Remove an unused RKN implementation and its 67 MB legacy index. The active checker builds its SQLite index on demand beside the configured database.
- Add offline regression tests and GitHub Actions CI for Python 3.12 and 3.13.
- Simplify installation and update the English documentation.
